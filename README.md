# GAL Study Group #1: ES6 Stuff!

### Agenda:

#### TLDR;

- Anna has a few videos to show
- Put it into practice
- Share & Discuss

## Topic

- **What is an ES6?**
  - ECMAScript 6 (ES6) is the sixth major release of the ECMAScript language specification. ECMAScript is the “proper” name for the language commonly referred to as JavaScript. [1](#references-i-used)

- **Where can I use this new syntax? Is it supported?**
  - You can see which browsers support which features [here](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/), in the compatibility table.
  - You can also _transpile_ your code from ES6 to the more widely supported ES5 we all know and love. Lots of folks use [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).

- **Why should I learn it?**
  - Awesome new features let you bind context (`this`) more easily, write more concisely (no more writing `function` a hundred million times), handle ansynchronicity (I `Promise` hyuk hyuk) more easily, and communicate your intentions to other developers (`let` vs. `const` for example). Check out this [article](https://thenextweb.com/dd/2016/03/09/6-reasons-need-learn-javascript-es6-now-not-later/) for some thoughts!
  - You'll probably see it a lot now if you write any React code, but you'll be seeing a lot of these features in more places as time goes by.

## Practice

- I've included a couple of files written in regular JS for us to practice re-writing in ES6. Let's work on these, then demonstrate and discuss!

## Next Week

- What do we want to learn?
- Who volunteers to research it?
